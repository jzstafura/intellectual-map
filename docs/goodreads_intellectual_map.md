# Your Reading Collection: An Intellectual Map

*Analysis of 452 books organized by core intellectual problems*

---

## **1. THE PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS**

### What you've read:
- **Foundational debates**: Dennett (complete works), Hofstadter (GEB, I Am a Strange Loop, Metamagical Themas), Jaynes (bicameral mind)
- **Neuroscience approaches**: Damasio (3 books), Edelman, LeDoux, Ramachandran, Koch, Kandel, Gazzaniga, Dehaene
- **Embodied/phenomenological**: Merleau-Ponty (on to-read), Lakoff/Johnson
- **Recent/alternative**: Goff (panpsychism), Blackmore, Tomasello

### Gaps:
- **The "hard problem" philosophers**: You've read the neuroscientists and eliminativists (Dennett, Churchland) but missing Chalmers, Nagel's full work beyond scattered references
- **Eastern perspectives**: Zero representation of Buddhist philosophy of mind, phenomenology from non-Western traditions
- **Integrated Information Theory**: Tononi (you have his co-authored book with Edelman but not IIT specifically)
- **Contemporary philosophy of mind**: Ned Block, John Searle's Chinese Room arguments, more recent analytic work

### Read next:
- **Thomas Metzinger** - *Being No One* or *The Ego Tunnel* (brings together neuroscience + phenomenology in ways you'll appreciate)
- **Evan Thompson** - *Waking, Dreaming, Being* (neuroscience meets Buddhist phenomenology, bridges your interests)
- **Andy Clark** - *Surfing Uncertainty* or *The Experience Machine* (predictive processing, extends your Dehaene reading)

---

## **2. THE PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE**

### What you've read:
- **Cognitive/evolutionary**: Pinker (4 books - How the Mind Works, Language Instinct, Words and Rules, Stuff of Thought), Tomasello
- **Structuralist foundations**: Saussure, Wittgenstein (Tractatus on to-read, but not Philosophical Investigations read yet)
- **Psycholinguistics**: Kroll/DeGroot handbook on bilingualism, Tokowicz on lexical processing
- **Literary theory**: Barthes, some Kristeva (on to-read)

**Note**: Your PhD concentration means you have deep coverage in experimental psycholinguistics, theories of reading, word learning, and EEG/ERP studies of online language processing - areas not visible in this Goodreads collection but representing substantial expertise.

### Gaps (acknowledging your experimental background):
- **Philosophy of language**: Austin, Grice, Kripke - the speech acts and pragmatics tradition
- **Sociolinguistics**: Labov, Eckert - language as social practice (you have sociology of violence but not language)
- **Historical linguistics**: Language change and evolution at the population level
- **Non-Indo-European perspectives**: All your visible language reading is Western-centric

### Read next:
- **Michael Tomasello** - *Constructing a Language* (you read his thinking book; this is his language magnum opus)
- **William Labov** - *Principles of Linguistic Change* (connects language to social structure in ways Collins would appreciate)
- **N.J. Enfield** - *How We Talk* or *Language vs. Reality* (conversation analysis meets cognitive science, different lens than experimental work)

---

## **3. THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE**

### What you've read:
- **Micro-sociology**: Currently reading Collins' *Violence*, have *Interaction Ritual Chains* queued
- **Ethnographic**: Stuart (*Ballad of the Bullet*), multiple true crime works as ethnographic data
- **True crime as data**: Wenzl, McNamara, Simon's *Homicide*, Bowden
- **Literary/philosophical**: Fanon (*Wretched of the Earth*)

### Gaps:
- **Structural violence**: Galtung, Farmer - the concept almost entirely missing
- **State violence**: Tilly, Weber on monopoly of violence, Agamben on exception
- **Gendered violence**: Rich theoretical literature you haven't touched
- **Historical sociology**: Moore's *Injustice*, Skocpol - why violence emerges when

### Read next:
- **Randall Collins** - Finish *Violence*, then read *Interaction Ritual Chains* (you have it queued - do it)
- **Charles Tilly** - *The Politics of Collective Violence* (historical scope Collins lacks)
- **Elijah Anderson** - *Code of the Street* (ethnographic, bridges to your crime fiction interests)
- **René Girard** - *Violence and the Sacred* (since you're reading Badiou, this fills a theoretical gap)

---

## **4. THE PROBLEM OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE**

### What you've read:
- **Classical theory**: Foucault (extensive), Frankfurt School (Adorno, Horkheimer), Marx implied
- **Contemporary**: Han (3 books), Fisher (3 books), Harvey (on to-read), Žižek (extensive)
- **Micro-level**: Collins (starting), Goffman implied through your interests
- **Network/systems**: Latour (on to-read), some Luhmann implied

### Gaps:
- **Classical sociology**: Durkheim, Weber beyond fragments - you've gone straight to contemporary
- **Economic sociology**: Granovetter, Zelizer - how markets actually work
- **Science studies**: You have Latour queued but haven't read the empirical STS work
- **Organizational theory**: Complete absence despite your startup background

### Read next:
- **Bruno Latour** - *Reassembling the Social* (you have *An Inquiry into Modes of Existence* started - maybe switch)
- **Gabriel Tarde** - *Monadology and Sociology* (you have it queued, bridges to Deleuze/Collins)
- **Harrison White** - *Identity and Control* (network theory meets phenomenology)
- **Max Weber** - *Economy and Society* (know the enemy; everything you read references him)

---

- **Literary theory**: Some Jameson (on to-read), Said
- **Philosophy of art**: Aristotle's *Poetics*, scattered references in your fiction
- **Horror/weird**: Thacker (complete Horror of Philosophy trilogy), Ligotti (on to-read)

### Gaps:
- **Phenomenology of art**: Heidegger on art completely missing, Gadamer
- **Cognitive approaches**: Little crossover between your neuroscience and aesthetic reading
- **Music/sound**: Given you have Green's *Sex Money Murder* tagged "music," this seems underexplored
- **Contemporary affect theory**: Massumi, Ahmed - hot in theory right now

### Read next:
- **Sianne Ngai** - *Ugly Feelings* or *Our Aesthetic Categories* (bridges theory + contemporary culture)
- **Brian Massumi** - *Parables for the Virtual* (affect theory, connects to your Deleuze queue)
- **Martin Heidegger** - *Poetry, Language, Thought* (the art essays - you need this for continental tradition)

---

- **Existential**: Sartre (Being and Nothingness 5-starred), Kierkegaard, Camus

- **Critical race/gender theory**: Almost complete absence
- **Asian philosophy**: Confucianism on self, Buddhist no-self traditions

### Read next:
- **Catherine Malabou** - *Ontology of the Accident* (you read *What Should We Do with Our Brain?* - this extends it to trauma meets plasticity)
- **Judith Butler** - *The Psychic Life of Power* (Foucault + psychoanalysis, fits your interests)
- **Maggie Nelson** - *The Argonauts* or *Bluets* (contemporary theory + memoir, like Didion but now)

---

## **7. THE PROBLEM OF TEMPORALITY**

### What you've read:
- **Philosophical**: Heidegger implied, Bergson missing, Husserl missing
- **Narrative**: Proust (vol 1, 5 stars), Knausgård (incomplete), your maximalist fiction
- **Historical**: Kuhn (*Structure of Scientific Revolutions*), Fukuyama implied through your reading
- **Memory**: Scattered through neuroscience (Kandel)

### Gaps:
- **This is your thinnest category** - temporality as explicit problem barely addressed
- **Phenomenology of time**: Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger on time
- **Historical theory**: Koselleck, Hartog - how we conceptualize historical time
- **Chronic illness/crip time**: Your interest in consciousness but not altered temporalities

### Read next:
- **Peter Osborne** - *The Politics of Time* (modernity + temporality + left theory)
- **Hartmut Rosa** - *Social Acceleration* (time + late capitalism, fits Han/Fisher interest)

- **Geographic theory**: Yi-Fu Tuan, Doreen Massey - the actual geographers
- **Urban studies**: Jane Jacobs, Mike Davis - how cities work
- **Colonial/postcolonial space**: Despite Said, missing Glissant, Mbembe
- **Digital space**: Nothing on virtuality, cyberspace, platform geography

### Read next:
- **Henri Lefebvre** - *The Production of Space* (you need this; everyone you read references it)
- **Mike Davis** - *City of Quartz* (LA noir meets Marxist geography, connects your fiction/theory)
- **Edward Casey** - *Getting Back into Place* (phenomenology of place, extends Bachelard)

---

### Political/ethical:
- **Ethics**: One Badiou book on it, but missing Singer, Korsgaard, MacIntyre
- **Critical race theory**: Wynter, Hartman, Moten - completely absent
- **Feminist theory**: De Beauvoir and some Kristeva, but no hooks, Haraway, Braidotti
- **Disability studies**: Despite neuroscience interest, no crip theory
